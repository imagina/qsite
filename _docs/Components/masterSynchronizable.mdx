# masterSynchronizable
The user interface (UI) component's primary function is to synchronize data in bulk. This is achieved through an entity called `isite__synchronizables`, where enabled synchronizations are listed.

## Prerequisites

Before using the synchronization modal, two conditions must be met:

1. **Synchronization Permissions:** The user must have specific permissions to perform data synchronization. These permissions can be configured by an administrator or a designated role.

2. **Existence of `name` in the Entity:** In the entity, the `name` field must match for the synchronization process to proceed. The `name` value is composed of the module's name, followed by `_sync`, and the entity's name (with the first letter capitalized). For example, if you want to synchronize products, the `name` should be `icommerce_syncProducts`.

## Current Features

So far, the mass data synchronization component offers the following features only:

- **Product Import:** Allows importing product data into the system.
- **Product Export:** Facilitates the export of product data from the system.

:::warning
Remember that mass data synchronization is a critical operation and should be performed with caution to prevent data loss or unexpected errors.
